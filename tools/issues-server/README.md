# issues-server

Local browser for the backlog in `.scratch/` (efforts, specs, maps, issues — see `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`)
the ADRs in `docs/adr/` and the domain glossary `CONTEXT.md`, with WYSIWYG editing (MDXEditor). Files are re-read on every request: edit the markdown,
refresh the page.

- `server/` — zero-dependency Node HTTP server (Node ≥ 24, TypeScript run natively), JSON API + built client.
- `client/` — React + Vite UI.

## Run

Env:

| Variable | Default | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| `ISSUES_PORT` | `4380` | API + built client port (also the Vite proxy target) |
| `ISSUES_HOST` | see above | Listen interface |
| `ISSUES_ROOT` | `../..` | Repo root, relative to `server/` |
| `ISSUES_SCRATCH_DIR` | `.scratch` | Backlog directory (efforts, specs, maps, issues), relative to the root |
| `ISSUES_ADR_DIR` | `docs/adr` | ADR directory, relative to the root |
| `ISSUES_CONTEXT_FILE` | `CONTEXT.md` | Domain glossary, relative to the root |
| `ISSUES_STATIC_DIR` | `client/dist` | Built client, relative to `issues-server/` (Vite `outDir` and served directory) |
| `ISSUES_DEV_PORT` | `4381` | Vite dev server port |

## API

| Route | Returns |
|-------|---------|
| `GET /api/config` | Configured `scratchDir`, `adrDir`, `contextFile` (the client resolves repo-rooted links with them) |
| `GET /api/efforts` | Efforts (`.scratch/<slug>/`) with spec title, issue count, per-Status counts |
| `GET /api/labels[?filterable=true]` | Every label key → value → occurrence count; `filterable=true` keeps the keys offered as filters (≤ 12 values of ≤ 30 chars, not `Blocked by`) |
| `GET /api/items?kind=&effort=&q=&label.<Key>=<value>` | Item summaries (no body); `kind` ∈ `issue`, `spec`, `map`, `adr`, `doc`, `context` |
| `GET /api/items/<url-encoded path>` | One item with its markdown body and `version`, e.g. `/api/items/docs%2Fadr%2F0001-….md` |
| `PUT /api/items/<url-encoded path>` | Saves `{ version, title, labels, body }`; `409` + current item if the file changed since `version` |

Labels are the `Key: value` lines between an item's `# Title` and its first section (`Status`, `Type`,
`Blocked by`, `Strength`…), or the YAML frontmatter of an ADR. `Blocked by: 02, 03` is resolved to sibling issues;
`blocked` is true when the item is open and one of them is not closed. `CONTEXT.md` (`context`) has no labels:
its intro lines are body text, and the editor hides the label form.

## Editing

**Edit** on an item opens the title, a label form (`Status`, `Type`…, with suggestions from existing values) and the
body in MDXEditor (rich text, or raw markdown via the source toggle). The server rewrites the file as
`# Title`, the label lines (or the ADR frontmatter), then the body. Only items the server listed can be written.

- `version` is the SHA-256 of the file when it was loaded: a save over a file an agent changed meanwhile is refused,
  the editor offers *reload from disk* or *overwrite*.
- MDXEditor runs with `suppressHtmlProcessing` (plain markdown, not MDX), so `<id>` or `{` in text do not break parsing.
- Saving normalises a few details: labels move to the top, `[` in text may be escaped as `\[`, list continuation
  indents are reset. Diff before committing.
- Writes are accepted only with a `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` `Host` header and `Content-Type: application/json`, which
  blocks DNS rebinding and cross-site form posts. Do not expose the server beyond the loopback interface.
